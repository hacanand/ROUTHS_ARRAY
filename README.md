# ROUTHS_ARRAY
This is a readme.md file for a C++ implementation of Routh's array, a method for determining the stability of a linear system. The program takes the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the system as input and outputs the Routh's array in a matrix form. The program also checks for special cases such as zero rows, sign changes, and auxiliary equations. The program can handle polynomials of any degree up to 7. To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

g++ routh.cpp -o routh
./routh
